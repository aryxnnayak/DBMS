Employee(emp_id, emp_name, salary, designation)
Salary_Backup(emp_id, old_salary, new_salary, salary_difference)
Create a Trigger to record salary change of the employee. Whenever salary is updated insert the details in

DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER RecordSalaryChange
AFTER UPDATE ON Employee FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.salary != OLD.salary THEN
        INSERT INTO Salary_Backup (emp_id, old_salary, new_salary, salary_difference)
        VALUES (OLD.emp_id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary, NEW.salary - OLD.salary);
    END IF;
END;
//
DELIMITER ;

2. Trigger to Prevent Deleting CEO Records:
-- Create the Prevent Deletion Trigger
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER PreventDeleteCEO
BEFORE DELETE ON Employee FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF OLD.designation = 'CEO' THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Deletion of CEO records is not allowed.';
    END IF;
